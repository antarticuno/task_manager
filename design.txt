Task Manager

- Tasks
- Users

Users can have zero or more tasks, tasks can be assigned to 0 or more people.

Thus, have a table for users, tasks, and an assigns table

Users
+ username
+ name

Tasks
+ title
+ description
+ completed

Assigns
+ user_id
+ task_id
+ time_spent





Future design considerations:

Managers table if users can have multiple managers:
+ manager_id
+ underling_id

Manager field if users can only have one manager


Time Blocks as another resource
